# Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
A simple weather application that allows users to search for a city to get the current weather and 5 day forecast. 
Cities that users previously looked up will be stored in their local storage. The overall purpose of this application
is to utilize the knowledge we have attained during this first two months of UCLA coding bootcamp
